  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Formerly Bodies is all about God's saving grace. While we are born into this world of sin, we are able to receive the gift of eternal life. Instead of being bound to these broken bodies that are tainted day after day, we can receive new life. When we encounter Jesus, our new life begins, and while we were formerly bodies, now we are eternally living.</p>
  <p>The theme of God's love and grace is evident through the music. Stories of brokeness and redemption, songs of new life, and music that has a direct line from your ears to your heart are sure to be found when listening. To encounter the music of Formerly Bodies, be sure to check out the tour dates and music section.</p>
